# bookBook

## What is this project?
bookBook was created in a brightly lit conference room on the campus of Holberton Tulsa.

Three Holberton School Tulsa peers set out to take what they've learned over a rigorous 20-month Software Engineer curriculum to create something magical! bookBook was inspired by avid readers and friends Kelsie, Staci, and Viet. Viet had spent too many hours scrolling through recommendations on his local library site. Kelsie had an itchy Machine Learning trigger finger. And Staci plopped down between both to have a little fun.
